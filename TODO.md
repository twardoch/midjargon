## PROBLEM: 

I did

`python -m midjargon fal "hello" -j`

I got

```
{
  "images": [],
  "prompt": "hello"
}ERROR: Could not consume arg: fal
Usage: __main__.py

For detailed information on this command, run:
  __main__.py --help
```

The correct output is the initial JSON, so it kind of works but then produces this error message which wasn't there earlier today.

## TASK: Fix the PROBLEM.

## PROPOSED PLAN:

1. Identify the root cause:
   - The duplicate implementation of the 'fal' command in src/midjargon/cli/main.py caused Fire to misinterpret arguments, leading to the error message after correct JSON output.

2. Resolution steps for the CLI command:
   - Remove the duplicate 'fal' command so that the correct implementation (supporting parameters such as --json_output and --no_color) is used exclusively.

3. Investigation of parameter parsing issues, focused on the 'personalization' parameter:
   - In core/parameters.py, the function _process_current_param handles flag parameters. For the 'personalization' parameter (shorthand 'p'), if no value is provided, it should yield None. This behavior is desired for CLI commands (Fal conversion).

4. Adjusting engine-specific parsing in MidjargonParser (src/midjargon/engines/midjourney/parser/core.py):
   - In _process_personalization, if the personalization parameter is provided as a flag (i.e. None or empty string), the engine should set it to True.
   - If a non-empty string value is provided, it is wrapped in a list. If the value is already a list (or a string representing a list, e.g. "['custom1', 'custom2']"), it is converted to an actual list using ast.literal_eval, ensuring consistency.

5. Outcome:
   - With these changes, running `python -m midjargon fal "hello" -j` outputs the correct JSON with no extraneous error message.
   - Meanwhile, engine tests expecting different behavior (e.g. flag --p converting to True in MidjargonParser) pass correctly.

6. Next steps:
   - Continue to run `hatch fmt; hatch test` to ensure that all tests pass and update the TODO until cleared.
